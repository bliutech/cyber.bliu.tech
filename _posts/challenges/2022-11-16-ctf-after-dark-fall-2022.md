I wrote three challenges for CTF After Dark - Fall 2022 for ACM Cyber at UCLA. This was an exciting CTF for my club because this is the first time we had advertised our internal CTF on [CTF Time](https://www.ctftime.org). The turn out was very impressive for the [event](https://ctftime.org/event/1780) making it a true success. Below I have attached the challenges. They are meant to be beginner friendly and cover content mentioned during the quarter at Cyber Academy. I decided to continue the theme from the last few challenges I wrote for my OSINT & social engineering workshop by also making these challenges involve Pokemon Go. I hope you enjoy the challenges!

## Pokemon Adventures (1/3) (OSINT 30)
**Prompt:** I recently have downloaded Pokemon Go and want to explore all the best gyms and PokeStops here at UCLA! However, my friend has been hiding where all of the good spots to catch Pokemon are. Can you help me find them?
My friend just posted this [photo](https://github.com/bliutech/cyber-tower/raw/main/challenges/ctf-after-dark-f22/pokemon-adventures-1/pokemon-1.png) of a great spot to study and take classes. The students here... seem a little different than the rest. Can you find which UCLA school is near here? (Hint: The flag is the name of the school all lower case and with underscores used as spaces. The full name is FOUR words. The answer must be wraped in flag{YOUR_ANSWER}.)

## Pokemon Adventures (2/3) (OSINT 30)
**Prompt:** I recently have downloaded Pokemon Go and want to explore all the best gyms and PokeStops here at UCLA! However, my friend has been hiding where all of the good spots to catch Pokemon are. Can you help me find them?
My friend just posted this [photo](https://github.com/bliutech/cyber-tower/raw/main/challenges/ctf-after-dark-f22/pokemon-adventures-2/pokemon-2.png) of a great spot to grab lunch with your Pokemon apparently. Can you find which UCLA eatery is near here? The students seem to have a cute name to call this place. (Hint: The flag is the name of the eatery all lower case and with underscores used as spaces. The full name is TWO words. The answer must be wraped in flag{YOUR_ANSWER}.)

My friend just posted this [photo](https://github.com/bliutech/cyber-tower/raw/main/challenges/ctf-after-dark-f22/pokemon-adventures-3/pokemon-3.png) of a great spot to hang out with your Pokemon. Can you find which UCLA building my friend is standing inside? (Hint: The flag is the name of the eatery all lower case and with underscores used as spaces. The full name is THREE words.
