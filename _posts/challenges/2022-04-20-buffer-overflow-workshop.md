I wrote two challenges for a [workshop]({{ "articles/buffer-overflow-workshop" | relative_url }}) I taught for ACM Cyber at UCLA on buffer overflow and binary exploitation basics. Below I have attached the challenges. They are meant to be beginner friendly and cover content mentioned during the workshop. I hope you enjoy them!

## Dave's Backyard (Overflow 20)
**Prompt:** Welcome to [Dave's Backyard](https://github.com/bliutech/cyber-tower/raw/main/challenges/cyber-academy-s22/daves-backyard/daves-backyard)! Dave is a cat. His neighbordhood is a 10 by 10 grid. Dave's territory is the territory within the coordinates 0 < x < 5 and 0 < y < 5. Dave wants to visit his dog buddy, Sam, who lives within the coordinates, 5 < x < 10 and 5 < y < 10. However, there is a terrible fence surrounding Dave's backyard preventing him from going directly to Sam's territory! How will Dave be able to see his friend?!?!
