To kick of the 2022-2023 academic year, my club, ACM Cyber at UCLA, hosted a general meeting to draw new students to attend. We decided to throw an introductory CTF to get students interested in the club. The theme of the CTF was ***cowboys***. I wrote two challenges for the meeting. Below I have attached the challenges. They are meant to be beginner friendly and cover content mentioned during the meeting. I hope you enjoy them!

## Tar Pits (File 10)
**Prompt:** We dragged this [file](https://github.com/bliutech/cyber-tower/raw/main/challenges/cyber-gm-f22/tar-pits/sludge.tar.gz) from the bottom of tar pits. See what might be HIDDEN in there.

## Cowslay ðŸ’… (Reveng 15)
**Prompt:** I just wrote the most amoozing program! It's so slay! Run ```java Cowslay -h``` to see how to use this [program](https://github.com/bliutech/cyber-tower/raw/main/challenges/cyber-gm-f22/cowslay/Cowslay.class). **Hint:** You may want to look up what a decompiler is!
