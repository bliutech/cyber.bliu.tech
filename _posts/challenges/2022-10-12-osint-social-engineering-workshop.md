I wrote three challenges for a [workshop]({{ "articles/osint-social-engineering-workshop" | relative_url }}) I taught for ACM Cyber at UCLA on Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) & social engineering. Below I have attached the challenges. They are meant to be beginner friendly and cover content mentioned during the workshop. For these challenges, I was inspired by researching some reconaissance vectors for the game Pokemon Go which is what the challenges below uses. I hope you enjoy them!

## Where's that Pokemon? (1/3) (OSINT 15)
**Prompt:** I recently have downloaded Pokemon Go and want to explore all the best gyms and PokeStops here at UCLA! However, my friend has been hiding where all of the good spots to catch Pokemon are. Can you help me find them? My friend just posted this [photo](https://github.com/bliutech/cyber-tower/raw/main/challenges/cyber-academy-f22/wheres-that-pokemon-1/pokemon-1.jpg) of a great spot to find Squirtles. Can you find which iconic UCLA monument is here? (Hint: The flag is the name of the monument all lower case and with underscores used as spaces. The answer must be wraped in flag{YOUR_ANSWER}.)

My friend just posted this [photo](https://github.com/bliutech/cyber-tower/raw/main/challenges/cyber-academy-f22/wheres-that-pokemon-2/pokemon-2.jpg) of a great spot where he found all three starter Pokemon: Squirtle, Charmander, and Bulbasaur! Can you find which iconic UCLA building they are facing? (Hint: The flag is the name of the building all lower case and with underscores used as spaces. The full name is TWO words. The answer must be wraped in flag{YOUR_ANSWER}.)

My friend just posted this [photo](https://github.com/bliutech/cyber-tower/raw/main/challenges/cyber-academy-f22/wheres-that-pokemon-3/pokemon-3.jpg) of a great spot to share a snack with Pokemon apparently.

The answer must be wraped in flag{YOUR_ANSWER}.)
