A website containing write ups, challenges, & other cybersecurity related content that I have worked on! The site was implemented using Jekyll. To access the site, visit [https://cyber.bliu.tech](https://cyber.bliu.tech). This site also acts a small project to help me 

Currently, I use the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme for Jekyll. I have made some attempts to make my own custom theme, but I have put that on hold for now. My hope is to eventually make my own theme for this site. To checkout some of the starter code, visit this [template repository](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter).

## Deploying the Site Locally
First, clone the repository and install the relevant Ruby gems using the following command.

```
bundle install
```

Next, in order to serve the site, run the following command.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You should then be able to see the site at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
