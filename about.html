        <p>👋 My name is Benson Liu! I'm a computer science major at UCLA who has an interest in cybersecurity! I compete in a lot of CTFs or Capture the Flag competitions which are jeopardy-style cybersecurity events. Currently, I am one of the Co-Presidents for <a href="https://acmcyber.com/">ACM Cyber at UCLA</a> and the Director for <a href="https://pbr.uclaacm.com/">Psi Beta Rho</a>, UCLA's competetive cybersecurity team!</p>

        <p>This site is a collection of articles, challenges, and writeups I have written for various cybersecurity related topics and problems. If you are interested in reading some of the cybersecurity topics I find interesting, check out some of my <a href="{{ 'articles' | relative_url }}"> articles</a>. If you want to see some of my writeups to the challenges I have solved or written in the past, check out <a href="{{ 'writeups' | relative_url }}">writeups</a>.</p>
