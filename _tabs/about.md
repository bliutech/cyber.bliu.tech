My name is Benson! I’m a computer science major at UCLA who has an interest in cybersecurity! I compete in a lot of CTFs or Capture the Flag competitions which are jeopardy-style cybersecurity events. Currently, I am one of the Co-Presidents for [ACM Cyber at UCLA](https://www.acmcyber.com/) and the Director for [Psi Beta Rho](https://pbr.acmcyber.com/), UCLA’s competetive cybersecurity team!

This site is a collection of articles, challenges, and writeups I have written for various cybersecurity related topics and problems. If you are interested in reading some of the cybersecurity topics I find interesting, check out some of my articles. If you want to see some of my writeups to the challenges I have solved or written in the past, check out [writeups](/categories/writeups/).
