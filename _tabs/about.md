_A photo of Benson at DEF CON 31 held in Las Vegas in 2023._

My name is Benson! I’m a computer science major at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) who has an interest in cybersecurity! I compete in a lot of CTFs or Capture the Flag competitions which are jeopardy-style cybersecurity events. I have interned at a variety of companies in security related roles such as [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/), and [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/). Previously, I was one of the Co-Presidents for [ACM Cyber at UCLA](https://www.acmcyber.com/) and the Director for [Psi Beta Rho](https://pbr.acmcyber.com/), UCLA’s competetive cybersecurity team! I also founded UCLA's largest cybersecurity competition, [LA CTF](https://lac.tf)!

This site is a collection of articles and writeups I have written for various cybersecurity related topics and CTF challenges. If you are interested in reading about some of my thoughts on cybersecurity topics I find interesting, check out some of my articles. If you want to see some of my writeups to the challenges I have solved or written in the past, check out [writeups](/categories/writeups/).
